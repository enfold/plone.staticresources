Update mockup=5.4.0. See https://github.com/plone/mockup/releases/tag/5.4.0

NOTE: This updates the selection button and popover.

The selection button shows now the number of selected and maximum number of items within the current folder.
The corresponding popover offers the option to select all items, all visible items on the page and to cancel the selection.
The previous popover to manage the selected items is gone.
There are also some minor fixes, e.g. one to prevent degrading the breadcrumb to show only ids, but rather keep the titles.
The upper-left checkbox in the table for selecting all the items has now a tooltip.
